# Sensory_memory_mediated_adaptation
This repository contains code to simulate neural and behavioral activity in the event of sensory memory mediated adaptation.

The details of the optimization based framework can be found in the paper:

**Short-term sensory memory mediates paradoxical neural-behavioral transformation in C. elegans**
Hamilton White, Sruti Mallik, ShiNung Ching, Dirk Albrecht (To appear in ELife)

All codes are in MATLAB. This repository contains only the preliminary codes for simulating the model, more MATLAB codes that create the figures in the paper will be released soon.
